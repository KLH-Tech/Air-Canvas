# Air-Canva
The project aims to develop an interface between the human hand and the system using open cv techniques and python language to pick the color and draw using a hand on the developed drawing area i.e., Air CANVA.
## Inspiration 
In the era of digital world traditional art of writing is being replaced by digital art. Static chalk boards and paper based lessons don't connect with students in digital age. Teachers forced to reply on chalk to reach students are doomed to fail. Forcing lessons into lectures or on chalkboards in the classroom will lead students to tune out before the class starts.
Interactive smart boards invite students to engage with the lessons. Air Canva aims to be an interface between man and machine in various applications of E-learning and students to experience fun based learning and increase their confidence throughout their learning journey.
## What it does
Drawing and writing with preferred colours are made possible using a hand on an air canvas displayed on the screen as a drawing area.  
## How we built it
This project is an interface for the humans and the system and is developed using opencv techniques and python.
